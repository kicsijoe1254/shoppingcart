Hello everybody!

I wrote this code as a practice for creating class, to work with OOP, 
to create/write/append to a csv file.

Basically this py will take a product name, a price for the product 
and quantity( as a piece of ..., and no other measurements such as kg, 
lib, etc) and creates a product with Item() class that was imported from the 
items folder. It will keep asking if you'd add more products. All added 
products will be stored in the "shopping_cart" list. As soon as you 
choose to stop adding to your cart, the code will look for "shopping_cart.csv" 
in the current working directory. When the code is being run for the first time 
it creates the csv file with the field names and than appends the stored items 
to the csv file.
